      <p>Ice hotels are temporary hotels present only during the winter period. One of those ice hotels is Sorrisniva Iglo Hotel in Alta, Norway. This hotel is being rebuilt regularly since 2000. It is 2000 square meters including 2 suites and it is decoated with numbers of ice sculptures and ice furnishing, and amazing lighting system to enhance the different ice crystals. Beside the bedrooms, Sorrisniva Igloo Hotel contains an ice chapel, ice gallery and ice bar in which the drinks are served in ice glasses.
Every year the theme in Sorrisniva Igloo Hotel is different. For example: in 2004 it was Viking theme, 2005 Norwegian fairytales and 2006 wild animals of the region.
This is the real place where you can experience the northern lights on the highest level. Another attraction is snowmobile safari or dog-sledding with Northern Light Husky, a dog sledding farm managed by professionals and suitable for everyone.</p>

        <p>Commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the remains of his cherished wife, the Taj Mahal stands on the southern bank of the Yamuna River in Agra, India. The famed mausoleum complex, built over more than 20 years, is one of the most outstanding examples of Mughal architecture, which combined Indian, Persian and Islamic influences. At its center is the Taj Mahal itself, built of shimmering white marble that seems to change color depending on the sunlight or moonlight hitting its surface. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983, it remains one of the world’s most celebrated structures and a stunning symbol of India’s rich history.</p>

        <a name="Out of this world"><h1>Fingal's Cave</h1>
          <img src="http://www.youramazingplaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-shot-2012-06-15-at-7.36.31-PM-620x436.png" width="430" height="260" alt="Fingal's Cave, Scotland" title="Fingal's Cave, Scotland"/>
          <p>Fingal's Cave is a sea cave on the uninhabited island of Staffa, in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland, known for its natural acoustics. The National Trust for Scotland owns the cave as part of a National Nature Reserve.The question "how was Fingal's Cave formed?" is often posed. Eminent visitors have seriously asserted that it must, because of its regularity and because it points exactly at Iona, have been hollowed out of the island by hand. In fact, the answer is straightforward. Since the layer of rock made up of columns would all have been laid down at one time it follows that when the tilting occurred there would have been pressure above the present site of the cave, and a fissure would have been forced open directly below, where sea now surges in. The violent action of huge waves that would have struck the island during storms over thousands of years developed the fissure, undermining dozens of columns, to create the opening we marvel at today.</p>
